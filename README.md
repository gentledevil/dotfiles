All hope abandon ye who enter here 😈

Nah, just kidding ❤️ althought you probably won't find anything super exciting in here, those are just a bunch of dotfiles.

Mostly they deal with setting shiny colors, setting a few preferences and installing a few add-ons.

In theory, they respect `XDG_` environment variables and work under various OS and shells, but some parts might be bitrotten or broken.

To use them easily, clone the repo in your `$HOME` and use the `setup.sh` script.
It doesn't modify anything, but it prints commands that you can use to selectively deploy them (mostly it helps you creating symlinks).
